##### Some of the tools I use are:
- [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the general styling and framework of the page. 
- [PrintJs](https://printjs.crabbly.com/) to change the content upon a print request. This small library just makes sure that you can print out something that is easier to read.
        
##### Programming Languages:     
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript
